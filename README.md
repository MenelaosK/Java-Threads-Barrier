# Java-Threads-Barrier
My implementation of the CyclicBarrier example using the java.util.concurrent package

Threads are created and run until they reach the Cyclic Barrier.
The Cyclic Barrier acts as a synchronizer that allows the threads to wait for each other to reach a common execution point. 
When the last thread reaches the barrier,they continue to run, exiting the barrier.
This example has 4 threads running.
